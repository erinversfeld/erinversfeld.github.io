<h1>ASL Voice Synthesiser with Myo</h1>
<p>Today I start experimenting with Myo's awesome armband, and developing my own little app for it! Beginning with the ASL alphabet, I hope to use the motion control technology to first type words out, and then have a voice synthesiser read what has been written.</p>
<p>It's a big project, the biggest I've ever taken on by myself, but I hope to build something really cool! At the end of the day, the purpose here is to provide a tool which will hopefully be used to teach hearing individuals to sign and to hopefully contribute to ending the stigma around Deafness in hearing communities</p>
