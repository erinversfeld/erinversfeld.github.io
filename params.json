  "body": "### Welcome to my playground.\r\nI'm in my final year of a B.A., majoring in Computer Science, Linguistics and Psychology. In my free time I like to build stuff, most of which I publish here. That being said, free time is a rare and precious things, so a lot of what I publish here ends up being assignments.\r\n\r\nFeel free to nose around and let me know what you think. Code reviews, issues, etc. are all welcome.\r\n\r\n### What am I currently up to\r\nMy latest project is a ASL Voice Synthesiser using the Myo armband technology. I'm currently just working on an app that will interpret and display the ASL alphabet and then read the resulting text out loud. Long term the dream are big, but I'm keeping it small for now.\r\n\r\n### What I've done in the past\r\nIf you're interested in code I've written, feel free to take a look at my [GitHub](https://www.github.com/erinversfeld) profile. Most of my work pertains to university projects but there are a few other points of interest.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, if you'd like to know more about my career thus far, go on over to my [LinkedIn](https://za.linkedin.com/in/erinversfeld) and/or [OfferZen](https://www.offerzen.com/erin-versfeld)",
